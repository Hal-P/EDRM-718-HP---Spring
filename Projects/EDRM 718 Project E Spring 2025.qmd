title: "The Relationship of Mathematics Scores to Reading Scores"
format: html
---

The *HSB2* data set consists of data from 200 randomly selected high school seniors. These data include five test scores, as well as demographic data. This report will show illustrate the relationship of mathematics scores to reading scores separately for each of three socioeconomic categories: low, medium, and high.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# Clear the environment
rm(list = ls())

# Load the libraries
library(here)

# Read in the data
hsb2 <- read.csv(here("Data", "hsb2.csv"))

# Create a separate matrix for each SES level that contains the five test scores
hsb2_low <- as.matrix(hsb2[hsb2$ses == 1, 7:11])
hsb2_med <- as.matrix(hsb2[hsb2$ses == 2, 7:11])
hsb2_high <- as.matrix(hsb2[hsb2$ses == 3, 7:11])

# Eliminate matrix row names
row.names(hsb2_low) <- NULL
row.names(hsb2_med) <- NULL
row.names(hsb2_high) <- NULL

# Create a list with these three matrices
hsb2_list <- list(Low = hsb2_low,
                  Medium = hsb2_med,
                  High = hsb2_high)

# Remove the temporary objects
rm(hsb2, hsb2_low, hsb2_med, hsb2_high)
```



```{r echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))  # Set up 3 plots in one row

for (ses in names(hsb2_list)) {  
  scores <- hsb2_list[[ses]]  
  
  # Calculate the correlation between reading and math scores
  correlation <- cor(scores[, "read"], scores[, "math"])
  
  # Round the correlation value for cleaner display
  rounded_correlation <- round(correlation, 2)
  
  # Create the scatter plot for reading vs math

  scores <- hsb2_list[[ses]]  
  for (i in 1:nrow(scores)) {  
    reading_score <- scores[i, "read"]  
    print(paste("SES:", ses, "Subject:", i, "Reading Score:", reading_score))  
  }  
}
