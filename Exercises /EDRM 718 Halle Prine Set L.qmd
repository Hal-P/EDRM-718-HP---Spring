These exercises are about tidying data. For each data set, take four steps.

1. Import the data.
2. Tidy the data. Make any missing data explicit.
3. Write the tidy data into the data folder in a file with the same name except replacing the word *messy* with *tidy* in the file name.
4. Print the data so that the knit version will show the complete tidy data set.

You may use both the tidyverse and Base R to complete these tasks.
